        <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped marinated artichoke hearts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Chardonnay wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 ounces shredded aged Cheddar cheese</li>

        </ul>

        <h1>Directions
        </h1>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Bring a large pot with water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain and reserve pasta water. </p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, combine tapioca starch, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet until it shimmers. Add chicken pieces and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. You might be tempted to add more olive oil or butter, don't do this.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Pour in reserved pasta water and add mushrooms, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic. Cook about 5 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Mix in white wine, cream and Cheddar cheese. Whisk until sauce is slightly thickened. Add rigatoni and toss to combine.</p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Add rigatoni and toss to combine. Serve immediately.</p>

        <h1>Cook's Notes</h1>
        <p>You can use the oil from either the artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes or both instead of the herb-infused olive oil.</p>
        <p>You can substitute flour for tapioca starch but I just like the silky texture the tapioca starch gives.</p>
        <p>I used cave-aged Cheddar cheese for this recipe that I buy at a specialty store, but you can use Cabot extra sharp Cheddar cheese instead.</p>
