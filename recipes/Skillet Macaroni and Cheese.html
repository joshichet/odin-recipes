    <h1>How to Make Skillet Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
    <p>Ditch the boxed stuff with this easy to make mac and cheese. With just a handful of ingredients it can be ready faster than boxed macaroni.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces macaroni</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 ounce heavy cream</li>
        <li>6 ounces grated Colby cheese</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Place a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in dry macaroni noodles. Pour in enough water to barely cover macaroni. Bring to a boil, stirring continuously.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Continue stirring the macaroni until water is almost evaporated and pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Pour in evaporated milk and cream. Add grated cheese and stir until cheese has melted and everything is well combined. Serve immediately.</p>
        
        <h2>Cook's Notes: </h2>
        <p>Any type of good quality cheese may be used. I suggest trying extra sharp Colby, but you can also try a blend of cheese.</p>
